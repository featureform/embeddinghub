# API Reference
### Welcome to the Featureform API Reference!

Featureform's Python API Reference provides a means to access hosted Featureform instances, as well as the ability to experiment in
Localmode. 

Using this SDK, you can [register](register.md) providers, sources, transformations, features, labels, and training sets 
both locally
and in a hosted instance. You can also use the [serving client](serve.md) functionality to retrieve training sets and 
features for online serving.
