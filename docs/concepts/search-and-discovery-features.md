# Search and Discover Features and Transformations

Features and the transformations backing them often hold value that transcends individual models and teams. Featureform offers built-in search and discovery capabilities, accessible via various avenues:

1. **Custom Tags:** Utilize [custom tags](tags-and-properties.md) to categorize and organize features, enhancing their discoverability.

2. **Feature Registry UI:** Our intuitive [feature registry UI](../getting-started/search-monitor-discovery-feature-registry-ui-cli.md) provides a comprehensive interface to examine the [lineage and the DAG](immutability-lineage-and-dags.md) of features, enabling you to understand their origins and relationships.

3. **CLI Commands:** Leverage list and get functions within the [CLI](../getting-started/search-monitor-discovery-feature-registry-ui-cli.md) to retrieve detailed information about features and their associated resources.

This set of Get functions empowers you to access any resource within the feature ecosystem, facilitating extensibility and collaboration workflows while ensuring the safety of downstream processes through [guaranteed immutability](immutability-lineage-and-dags.md). This integrated feature search and discovery mechanism streamlines collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the effective utilization of features across your organization, notebooks, and models.
