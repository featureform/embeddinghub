Each registration call incorporates two parameters: [properties and tags](https://sdk.featureform.com/properties_and_tags/). Tags takes the form of a Python list containing strings, while properties is a dictionary encompassing scalar values (strings and numbers). These attributes can be conveniently accessed, searched, and modified through the Feature Registry UI as well.
