## Configuration

First we have to add a declarative Qdrant configuration in Python. The following example shows the required fields.

```python
import featureform as ff

qdrant = ff.register_qdrant(
    name="qdrant-quickstart",
    grpc_host="xyz-example.eu-central.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6334",
    api_key="<API_KEY>",
    useTls=true,
    description="A Qdrant project for using embeddings in Featureform"
)

client.apply()
```

Once our config file is complete, we can apply it to our Featureform deployment. Afterwards we can set it as the [Vector DB](vector-db.md) when defining an [embedding](../abstractions/embedding.md).

We can re-verify that the provider is created by checking the [Providers tab of the Feature Registry or via the CLI](../getting-started/search-monitor-discovery-feature-registry-ui-cli.md).
