# redis.conf

# By default Redis listens for connections from all the available network interfaces.
# To listen on a specific IP, you can use the following.
bind 0.0.0.0

# Enabling protected mode
protected-mode yes

# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other
# commands. This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust
# others with access to the host running redis-server.
#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most
# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).
#
# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
# 1M passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
