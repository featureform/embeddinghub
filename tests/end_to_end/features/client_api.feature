Feature: Client API

  Scenario: Data Source Columns (SQL Provider)
    Given Featureform is installed
    When I create a "hosted" "insecure" client for "localhost:7878"
    When I register postgres
    And I generate a random variant name
    And I register a table from postgres
    Then I should get the columns for the data source from "postgres"

  Scenario: Data Source Columns (Spark)
    Given Featureform is installed
    When I create a "hosted" "insecure" client for "localhost:7878"
    And I generate a random variant name
    And I register "s3" filestore with bucket "featureform-spark-testing" and root path "data"
    And I register databricks
    And I register transactions_short.csv
    Then I should get the columns for the data source from "spark"

  Scenario: Reusing Providers
    Given Featureform is installed
    When I create a "hosted" "insecure" client for "localhost:7878"
    And I generate a random variant name
    And I register "s3" filestore with bucket "featureform-spark-testing" and root path "data"
    And I register databricks
    Then I should be able to get spark provider
    And I should be able to register transactions_short.csv
    And I should be able to get the data of the resource

  Scenario: Reusing Sources
